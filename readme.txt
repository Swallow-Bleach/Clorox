Read me

Hello. This is my first C# code.
It's made for Halloween. I had to wear clothes like FF and learn the lyrics to one of his songs.
But I couldn't choose, so I had to write a simple randomizer code that I could send to a friend who
add some of his favorite tracks.
And so the code includes its list in my list and the randomizer will choose one.

That's all :o)
